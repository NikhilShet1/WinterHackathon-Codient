Project Name: Silent Signals

Description
Silent Signals is an academic risk detection system that uses machine learning–based anomaly detection to identify students who may be disengaging academically. Instead of relying on self-reported surveys, the system analyzes routine academic signals such as attendance, assignment delays, and grades to flag early warning signs.

The project focuses on early intervention, explainability, and privacy-aware design, making it suitable for educational institutions and mentoring programs.
